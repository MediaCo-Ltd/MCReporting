change to nvar ? at least work out what lengths to have MAX is wrong for most

this works
so when building up a view can do like as numbers will be in order
3,6,100 & so on
SELECT        Id, JobId, JobTypeId, GroupIds, GroupSelection, DeptIds, DeptSelected, QuoteItemID, QuoteItemsAlpha
FROM            Logs
WHERE        (GroupIds LIKE '%3,4%')

or may need to do GroupIds LIKE '%3' or GroupIds LIKE '%4%'
this works
SELECT        Id, JobId, JobTypeId, GroupIds, GroupSelection, DeptIds, DeptSelected, QuoteItemID, QuoteItemsAlpha
FROM            Logs
WHERE        (GroupIds LIKE '%3%') OR
                         (GroupIds LIKE '%100%') OR
                         (GroupIds LIKE '%4%')

will have to use selected becuase %3% will get 3, 13, 23 and so on So WHERE (GroupSelection LIKE '%03,13%') 
so may not use the numeric Id ones at all

may also need the shift times bit
